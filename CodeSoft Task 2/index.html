            <h3>SMART AUTOMATION</h3>
            <p> Urban areas often face significant traffic congestion, especially at intersections where multiple routes converge. Traditional traffic management systems rely on pre-set traffic light timings, which may not adapt well to fluctuating traffic conditions. This can lead to increased waiting times, fuel consumption, and emissions. An AI-based traffic management system can dynamically adjust traffic light timings based on real-time traffic data, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion. Problem statement is to develop a smart, AI-based traffic management system that can monitor traffic conditions in real-time and adapt traffic light timings accordingly. The system should be capable of handling heavy traffic from multiple directions and optimizing traffic flow to minimize delays and improve overall efficiency.</p>

            <h3>LANDING PAGE</h3>
            <p>    
                A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners. It requires basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this project, you'll learn to create columns, divide sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is unleashing your creativity to design an impressive page. Pay attention to alignments, padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping elements. In short, a landing page project allows you to apply HTML and CSS skills, encouraging your creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.</p>
